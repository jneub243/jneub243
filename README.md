### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Jaden Neubauer and this is my README!

I have never really been huge into coding, but I look forward to getting a chance to get more hands on this semester.
A little bit about me:
In high school I has heavily involved in FIRST Robotics which is what got me wanting to do engineering. I was also involved in soccer, theater, and trap shooting. Currently I like to CAD and 3D print as well as stream videogames. I mostly play Rocket League, but I also play Rainbow Six Siege. I am super excited to be learning more about coding in this course!
